Few people or organizations fund academic research in this sphere without the expectation of some return, though it may not always be monetary.
Universities still have the capacity to drive research, and they stand to benefit in myriad ways; recuitment, donations, publishing, licensing, prestige
Private estates can also play a vital role in funding, but often have fewer back end revenue streams from which they can later benefit
Investors from the Tech and financial sectors can become involed when the products of research, OR THE BYPRODUCT, constitute a valuabe intellectual property
  The development of an enhanced OCR program that was implemented to process a historical collection, can later be licensed out to a broad array of groups at a substantial gain for the initial investors
Questions remain for me after the transcribe Bentham reading
  Is credit enough for the army of volunteers that work on thsi project? Should they not benefit in a more concrete sense upon completion?
  Is the tech developed for this product going to end up being more important than the project itself?
    Who will own this tech? Who will benefit?
Carleton provides some services through its digitization hub
  They do have strict criteria that can prevent students from untilising the service
     Copyright, physical location, demand, strategic priority, and staffing all present barriers to an otherwise potenmtially useful service
I could be a simple cog in the machine right now, with the ability to learn to digitize, and perhaps aid research. Without finacial backing or more a more refined skillset, I am limited for now.
