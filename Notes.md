Problems encountered with wget
  Had to switch from powersheel to commandprompt and back more than once
  wget: the response content cannot be parsed because the internet explorer engine is not available, or internet explorer's first-launch configuration is not complete.
  solved at https://www.robvit.com/automation/invoke-webrequest-the-response-content-cannot-be-parsed-because-the-internet-explorer-engine-is-not-available/
  Cannot bind parameter'websession'
  solved with switch to commandprompt (skirted)
  Problems locating urls.txt file
  Eventually solved by saving file for 10th time by actually typing "urls.txt" in the text box while saving instead of typing "urls" and selecting txt in the file type
